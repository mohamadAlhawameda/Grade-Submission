# Grade Submission 

#### The Grade submission is a RESTful API for managing grades of students in courses. It allows clients to perform operations such as retrieving a specific grade by student ID and course ID, saving a new grade, updating an existing grade, deleting a grade, and retrieving grades based on student ID, course ID, or all grades. The API is built using the Spring framework in Java and utilizes the GradeService class for handling the business logic. The endpoints are mapped to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and return appropriate response entities with HTTP status codes.

#### The project I have developed incorporates comprehensive exception handling and robust security measures for user login and registration functionalities. The code includes exception handling mechanisms to handle potential errors or exceptional scenarios that may occur during the execution of the API endpoints. This ensures that any unexpected issues are properly captured and handled, preventing the application from crashing or exhibiting unpredictable behavior. Regarding security, the project employs industry-standard security practices to safeguard user credentials and ensure secure access to the system. It utilizes Spring Security, a powerful security framework, to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. The code includes authentication filters that facilitate secure user login by validating and authenticating user credentials. Additionally, it incorporates token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which enhance security by generating and validating tokens for authorized access to protected resources.

#### For user registration, the project leverages security best practices to protect sensitive information. It incorporates validation mechanisms to ensure that user-provided data is accurate and meets the required criteria. This helps to maintain data integrity and prevent invalid or malicious data from being stored in the system.

#### In summary, the project demonstrates a strong focus on exception handling to handle errors gracefully and includes robust security measures for secure user login and registration. By addressing exception scenarios and implementing stringent security practices, the project aims to provide a reliable and secure environment for users to interact with the system.
